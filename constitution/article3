Article 3 (Meeting Procedure):
The meetings of the esteemed Literati shalt henceforth officially be known as: The Convergence of the Hobos, henceforth referred to as Meetings. It is the rules and regulations of such meetings that follows below:
Considering the pre-stated goals listed in article 2, the main principle of concern and that of which all other principles do flow from is thus: The weekly to bi-weekly commencement of a digital (via zoom) or non-digital meeting in which the literature of Principle Sibling’s request shalt be discussed. The rules of such meetings are listed now: (1) The meeting’s primary and ever-persistent focus shalt be that of the book. (2) The meetings shalt always remain un-recorded unless otherwise agreed upon by all acting members. (3) The Principle Sibling shalt be the acting and unquestioned authority on all such proceedings — unless it is seen that the Principle Sibling has acted against the constitution, the steps for such a procedure will be listed in article 4.
