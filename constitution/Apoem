```
Opening Poem:
There's a race of men that don't fit in,
	A race that can't stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
	And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
	And they climb the mountain's crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
	And they don't know how to rest.
```
