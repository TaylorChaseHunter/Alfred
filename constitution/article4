Article 4 (Principle Sibling):
It shalt be seen by all that in order to achieve the stated goals of this association, the principle of which is the consumption of literature, an acting ‘head of state’ shalt be required. This ‘head of state’ — henceforth referred to as Principle Sibling — Is formed and regulated in the following manner: (1) The position is held by one and only one member of the Literati. (2) The position is ordained by means of structured rotation, it is passed between each member after a meeting is successfully adjourned. (3) A member can choose to ‘pass’ such position if they so choose. They are thus skipped in the rotation. (4) The Principle Sibling has full power to choose the book for the meeting to read — unless faithful mulligan is called and respected [See section 6]. (5) The Principle Sibling is the acting power of the meetings and as full authority to direct it as seen fit. (6) A member can call a ‘Mulligan’ on a book chosen by the Principle Sibling. The Mulligan shalt be a rare and choice power, as it is imperative that the Principle Sibling be trusted, but if it is aptly heard out and seen to be in lawful accordance with this constitution, the Principle Sibling must be forced to choose another book.
