 Article 7 (The Long Book Clause):
[Appended on December 31st, 2021]
Going forward with all future books chosen by the Principle Sibling (See Article 4), all books not unanimously considered classics must thusly be under 3 SHF length. Anything that is considered a classic is allowed to pass this length, but a temporal limit of one month is placed on the book before the next convergence is continued. This allows for the mission (as stated in Article 2) to still be accomplished with the classics, but a streamlined nature is still maintained and progress is not hindered.
