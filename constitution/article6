Article 6 (SHF Standard):
[Appended on December 31st, 2021]
In an effort to standardize the evaluation of literature length, a new metric in the way of Slaughter House Five book-length (SHF unit abbreviation) shall be used â€” I.E. The book Cold Moutain is 161,511 words long, this 3.265553 Slaughter House Fives long (3.25 SHF rounded). In all manners concerning the bureaucratic or scientific analysis of book-length this metric must be used, so as to maintain both professionality and consistency.
